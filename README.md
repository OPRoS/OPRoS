OPRoS
=====

The Open Platform for Robotic Services (OPRoS) is a component based open source platform, and it has Integration Development Environment (IDE) tools, a robot framework for robot operation, a server,  and a test and verification tool.

OPRoS has dual licenses, the LGPL and an individual commercial license.

The LGPL is for using OPRoS source code without making any changes or publishing the changed code (okay for commercial use too), and the individual commercial license is for not publishing the changed source code (technology transfer).
